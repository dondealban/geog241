	abstract = {In this paper I explore the connections between zombie films and bodies–cities. Common critical and popular analyses of zombie films focus on the body of the zombie, but pay little attention to surrounding spaces. Zombie films of the past ten years are increasingly being set in cities, a trend that I argue allows for the transfer of the ambiguous identity of zombie bodies to city spaces. The zombie outbreak creates an ‘other’-space that I term blank space in which previously rigidly codified spaces are subject to new constructions that reinscribe bodies with new, and potentially ‘other’, subjectivities. Through an analysis of six zombie films (Night of the Living Dead, Land of the Dead, Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, 28 Days Later, and 28 Weeks Later), I argue that for geographers, zombie films can be read as expressions of a bodies–cities theory that emphasizes the role that spatial and bodily otherness plays in the constitution of bodies and cities. For bodies–cities theory, zombies offer a manifestation of the mutuality between bodies and cities that foregrounds corporeality while articulating the importance of difference and otherness for the constitution of bodies and cities.},

	abstract = {This article introduces comic books as a medium through which national identity and geopolitical scripts are narrated. This extension of the popular geopolitics literature uses the example of post-11 September 2001 (“9/11”) Captain America comic books to integrate various strands of theory from political geography and the study of nationalism to break new ground in the study of popular culture, identity, and geopolitics. The article begins with an introduction to the character of Captain America and a discussion of the role he plays in the rescaling of American identity and the institutionalization of the nation's symbolic space. The article continues by showing how visual representations of American landscapes in Captain America were critical to constructing geopolitical “realities.” A reading of post-9/11 issues of the Captain America comic book reveals a nuanced and ultimately ambiguous geopolitical script that interrogates America's post-9/11 territorialization.},

Uses examples that address both physical geography and human geography.     Use a familiar and real-world example - ‘the beach’ - as an entry point to basic questions of philosophy, returning to this to illustrate and to explain the links between philosophy, theory, and methodology.    All chapters end with summaries and sources of further reading, a glossary explaining key terms, exercises with commentaries, and web resources of key articles from the journals Progress in Human Geography and Progress in Physical Geography. A Student's Introduction to Geographical Thought is a completely accessible student A-Z of theory and practice for both human and physical geography.},
