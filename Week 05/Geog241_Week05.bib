	abstract = {An approach to the visualization of georeferenced data is presented. This approach is rooted in cartography and emphasizes the use of visual methods in research and decision making. Several definitions proposed within cartography are considered and the links between “cartographic” visualization and scientific visualization more generally are discussed. From this base, a perspective on visualization is articulated in which attention is directed to the goals for use of maps and related georeferenced displays. We argue that a use-based approach is needed in order to develop information processing environments appropriate to distinct stages of scientific research and decision making. The paper concludes by proposing a set of research problems that are prompted by taking a use-based approach to visualization, and then outlining the selection and context of the papers in this special issue.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the possibility that there may be commonalities between physical geography and human geography in emerging ways of conceptualizing space, time and space-time. It argues that one of the things holding physical and human geography apart for so long has been their relationship to physics as an assumed model of ‘science'. It is proposed here that not only is this an inadequate model of science but that it has led us astray in our inherited conceptualizations of both time and space. The urge to think ‘historically’ is now evident in both physical and human geography. The paper argues that this both forms the basis for a possible conversation and also obliges us to rethink our notions of space/space-time.},

	abstract = {Political ecology has emerged as an interdisciplinary space where concepts from the physical and social sciences are utilized to understand nature-society relationships. In this paper, we explore how political ecologists have used concepts from nonequilibrium ecology to address concerns over the interactions between land management and livelihood practices. We begin by demystifying how equilibrium and nonequilibrium have been used in ecology, demonstrating the dialectical relationship between these divergent frameworks and how each impacts understandings of living systems. Then, we review how political ecologists employ these concepts to examine environmental knowledge production, as well as the role of livelihoods and anthropogenic disturbances in conservation and restoration. We also discuss how nonequilibrium ecology has shaped our own research trajectories and finish the paper by offering some reflections on the possibilities and pitfalls for political ecology’s use of nonequilibrium ecology to bridge the physical-human divide in geography.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade or more, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have been re-imagined and reconfigured through critical GIS research and practice, as scholars and activist have sought new ways of engaging GIS beyond its characterization in the 1990s as a rationalist and rationalizing tool. Where many existing discussions of the contributions of critical GIS have focused on its position and impacts in GIScience, here I review recent work in critical GIS with an eye toward highlighting its contributions and possibilities in critical human geography. This study examines the theorizations, epistemological frameworks, and methodological innovations are enabling human geographers to engage with GIS, cartography, and geovisual methods in their work in creative ways. I begin by unpacking the ‘critical’ in critical GIS, illustrating how it has drawn upon theory and politics from critical theory to offer a series of key reconceptualizations of GIS and its knowledge-making repertoire. Then, I illustrate the ever-diversifying ways in which critical GIS theory and practice are being woven into geographers’ research and activism.},

It makes abstract ideas explicit and clearly connects it with real practices of geographical research and knowledge.  Written with flair and passion, A Student's Introduction to Geographical Thought:        Explains the key ideas: scientific realism, anti-realism and idealism / positivism / critical rationalism / Marxism and critical realism/ social constructionism and feminism / phenomenology and post-phenomenology / postmodernism and post-structuralism / complexity / moral philosophy.     Uses examples that address both physical geography and human geography.     Use a familiar and real-world example - ‘the beach’ - as an entry point to basic questions of philosophy, returning to this to illustrate and to explain the links between philosophy, theory, and methodology.    All chapters end with summaries and sources of further reading, a glossary explaining key terms, exercises with commentaries, and web resources of key articles from the journals Progress in Human Geography and Progress in Physical Geography. A Student's Introduction to Geographical Thought is a completely accessible student A-Z of theory and practice for both human and physical geography.},

	abstract = {Visualization in Modern Cartography explores links between the centuries-old discipline of cartography and today's revolutionary developments in scientific visualization. The book has three main goals: (1) to pass on design and symbolization expertise to the scientific visualization community - information that comes from centuries of pre-computer visualization by cartographers, and their more recent experiences with computerizing the discipline; (2) to help cartographers cope with the dramatic shift from print cartography to a dynamic virtual cartography for which their role is changing from that of map designer to one of spatial information display (and/or interface) designer; (3) to illustrate the expanded role for cartography in geographic, environmental, planning, and earth science applications that comes with the development of interactive geographic visualization tools. To achieve these goals, the book is divided into three parts. The first sets the historical, cognitive, and technological context for geographic/cartographic visualization tool development. The second covers key technological, symbolization, and user interface issues. The third provides a detailed look at selected prototype geographic/cartographic visualization tools and their applications.},
