	abstract = {The effects of rationalization and bureaucratization on the landscape are myriad and contradictory. The unforeseen environmental consequences resulting from modern planning create new geographies far beyond those of the planner’s design. This article explores the land-cover effects of state-sponsored modernization efforts in the semiarid Godwar region of Rajasthan, India. Using satellite imagery, historical data, household production information, and the discourse of state planners, the research described here explores the land covers that result from agricultural intensification, biodiversity preservation, and resource conservation in postindependence development. The study demonstrates that through these efforts, state planners have attempted to physically partition those land uses seen as “social” from those seen as “natural” and thereby enforce a modernist purification of land covers. Despite these efforts—indeed, because of them—hybrid and “impure” land covers, which mix social and natural characteristics and combine exogenous and indigenous species, have proliferated across the landscape. Moreover, these quasiforests have proven impossible to control or quarantine. The results of analysis, therefore, suggest that these sorts of unexpected land-cover changes necessarily grow out of the very attempts to halt them through modernization, and that, despite our best efforts, following Bruno Latour, our landscapes have never been modern.},

	abstract = {Postcolonial theory has asserted the need to carefully consider how present-day social and cultural practices are marked by histories of colonialism. This paper explores representations of the ‘rainforest’ and ‘nature’ in British Columbia, Canada, and traces a series of ‘buried epistemologies’ through which neocolonial relations are asserted in the region. Drawing upon recent representations of the forest proffered by the forest industry and the environmental movement, and the historical writings of a prominent nineteenth-century geologist and amateur ethnologist, the author shows how ‘nature’ (‘wilderness’) has been constructed as a realm separate from ‘culture.’ He locates in this the possibility for contemporary practices that abstract and displace the ‘forest’ from its cultural surrounds and relocate it within the abstract spaces of the market, the nation, and, in recent ecological rhetorics, the biosphere and the global community. By so doing, the author contests assumptions that colonialism is only an ‘ugly chapter’ of Canadian history and argues instead that colonialist practices and rhetorics remain present but unthought in many of the categories, identities, and representational practices that are deployed today both in public debate and scientific management of ‘natural landscapes’ and ‘natural resources.’ Thus, amid the current popularity of notions like sustainable development, biodiversity management, ecosystem restoration, and so on—which risk abstracting natural ‘systems’ apart from their cultural surrounds—it is essential to recognize the colonial histories and neocolonial rhetorics that continue to infuse ‘commonsense’ categories and identities like ‘nature’ and ‘resources’.},
