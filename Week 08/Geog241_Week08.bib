	abstract = {Drawing on work surrounding the theorisation of concepts such as mobility, affect and emotion, the paper argues that their control is now being intertwined in places like airports which are employing a number of techniques that engineer affects. Airport affect is enacted, in one way, by planning and designing the situational affective context one inhabits – throwing up structures of ethological possibility that shape capacities for the corporeal body to move and be moved. It is shown that the engineering of airport affect is premised upon a wider discursive framework of calculation and indeterminacy, and that selective techniques summon a number of different modalities of control. The paper concludes with a series of implications for the understanding of power, and the study of mobility, emotion and affect.},

	abstract = {This research examines how a group of mothers in Hamilton, Aotearoa New Zealand are developing and maintaining emotional and familial links with their children of a variety of ages via video calls using Skype. More specifically it seeks to deepen understanding of how seeing one's child or children as part of the communication affects mothers' feelings towards their children. The research is informed by Sara Ahmed's work on ‘queer phenomenology’ and the ‘cultural politics of emotions’, which enabled a critical engagement on mothers' and children's embodied and emotional relationships via screens that convey ‘real-time’ images. Interviews with thirty-five mothers, twenty-four of whom use Skype to contact their children or maintain contact with their own mothers, revealed that the dwelling places of bodies are no longer just rooms in homes where mothers, and children's flesh and emotions rub up against each other on a daily basis but screens across which voices and, even more importantly, images are shared. More than half the mothers who were interviewed reported that using Skype with real-time video to see their children reduced feelings of distance. They also reported that ‘seeing’ their child or children enables them to assess their children's well-being more accurately. In this way the computer screen, as object, by portraying moving visual images, is ‘reorientating’ mothers' and children's bodies offering a seemingly closer physical and emotional proximity than in the past.},

	abstract = {This ism-busting text is an enormously accessible account of the key philosophical and theoretical ideas that have informed geographical research. It makes abstract ideas explicit and clearly connects it with real practices of geographical research and knowledge.  Written with flair and passion, A Student's Introduction to Geographical Thought:        Explains the key ideas: scientific realism, anti-realism and idealism / positivism / critical rationalism / Marxism and critical realism/ social constructionism and feminism / phenomenology and post-phenomenology / postmodernism and post-structuralism / complexity / moral philosophy.     Uses examples that address both physical geography and human geography.     Use a familiar and real-world example - ‘the beach’ - as an entry point to basic questions of philosophy, returning to this to illustrate and to explain the links between philosophy, theory, and methodology.    All chapters end with summaries and sources of further reading, a glossary explaining key terms, exercises with commentaries, and web resources of key articles from the journals Progress in Human Geography and Progress in Physical Geography. A Student's Introduction to Geographical Thought is a completely accessible student A-Z of theory and practice for both human and physical geography.},
